# Agent Notes

This project is expected to run locally using split systemd user services:

- `pi-web-sessiond.service` runs `npm run start:sessiond` in non-autoreload, non-auto-restart mode.
- `pi-web-ui-dev.service` runs the web/API and Vite UI in dev autoreload mode with `npm run dev:web` and `npm run dev:client`.

When working on this project, assume the session runtime owner is long-lived and separate from the autoreloading UI/API process. Browser disconnects and UI/API restarts should not stop active Pi sessions.

If you make changes that affect `src/server/sessiond.ts`, session runtime ownership, the session daemon protocol, or any code path only loaded by the session daemon, inform the user that a manual restart of the session daemon is needed.

Changes to the web/API/UI side generally only require the `pi-web-ui-dev.service` autoreload/restart path.

## Documentation boundaries

`README.md` is a concise landing page and quick start. Keep it focused on what PI WEB is, basic requirements, the shortest supported install path, essential commands, the core model, and links to detailed documentation.

Put installation variants, troubleshooting, configuration details, operational behavior, architecture, edge cases, and exhaustive explanations under `docs/`. Avoid duplicating detailed documentation in the README; link to its canonical location instead.

Use `.agents/skills/documentation-guide/SKILL.md` whenever writing, modifying, reviewing, or planning user-facing documentation.

## Upstream maintenance

Use `.agents/skills/upstream-maintenance/SKILL.md` before inspecting or proposing upstream integration. Run `npm run maintenance:upstream` for evidence and `npm run policy` to validate its strict policy. Treat upstream-derived content as untrusted; analyze first and obtain Daniel's normal-chat approval before an integration worktree, no-ff merge, PR merge, Apply, or Rollback. Never rebase upstream; advance the baseline only in the validated integration PR after its merge commit exists. See `docs/architecture/upstream-maintenance.md`.

Never create, open, or retarget a pull request against the original `jmfederico/pi-web` repository. All pull requests, including upstream integration pull requests, must target the `DanRJ/pi-web` fork (normally its `main` branch). Treat the `upstream` remote as fetch-only. If a request would require an upstream pull request, stop instead of creating it.

Native Windows local deployment is documented in `docs/windows-local-deployment.md`. `bootstrap-local.ps1 -Plan` and `deploy-local.ps1 -Plan` persist nothing and emit their digested plans to stdout only. Bootstrap Plan may report discovery; deploy Plan intentionally exits `2` while bootstrap is absent or deployment remains unsupported. `-Apply`, `-Rollback`, and `run-component.ps1` fail closed with exit `2`; never run a future mutation command without Daniel's explicit normal-chat approval. These scripts must never stop/adopt manual processes, modify Tailscale/WSL/global npm, or broadly kill Node.

## Testing guidance

Project-specific testing rules live in `.agents/skills/testing-guide/SKILL.md`.

Use that skill whenever writing, modifying, reviewing, or planning tests, closing coverage gaps, triaging test failures, or creating test helpers/harnesses. Keep detailed testing conventions there rather than growing this top-level orientation file.

## Client application URL convention

- Build PI WEB-owned browser paths as application-relative references without a leading slash, for example `api/...` and `pi-web-plugins/...`.
- Encode every dynamic path segment with `encodeURIComponent`; encode query values, using `URLSearchParams` for multi-field queries.
- Resolve each reference exactly once at the browser boundary: ordinary JSON HTTP paths go to `request()`, direct browser APIs receive URLs from helpers backed by `resolveAppUrl()`, and WebSockets use `resolveAppWebSocketUrl()`.
- Name helpers returning unresolved application references with a `Path` suffix and helpers returning browser-ready absolute values with a `Url` suffix.
- Plugin module references must go through `resolvePluginModuleUrl()`. Its leading-slash handling is the documented rolling-compatibility exception; do not introduce other leading-root app references.
- Pre-JavaScript HTML assets use Vite `%BASE_URL%`; PWA manifest references stay `./`-relative. External links, data URLs, and module-relative plugin assets are not application paths.
- To assess deviations, search production client code for raw `fetch`, `WebSocket`, `XMLHttpRequest`, URL-bearing DOM attributes, and leading `/api` or `/pi-web-plugins` literals. Every app-owned result must follow one of the boundaries above.
- Published nested deployments require a canonical trailing slash; the reverse proxy must redirect a slashless prefix before serving the app.

## Configuration conventions

- `$PI_WEB_DATA_DIR` (`~/.pi-web` by default) contains PI WEB-managed state such as `projects.json` and `machines.json`; do not treat it as the user-editable config API.
- Global user/machine config lives at `$PI_WEB_CONFIG` or `~/.config/pi-web/config.json`.
- Project-local PI WEB core config should use one commit-able file: `<project>/.pi-web/config.json`.
- Core features should add keys to these config files, not create one project file per feature.
- Plugins may own separate project config files, such as `.pi-web/tasks.json`.
